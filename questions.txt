* Is there an update monad story?
  * Can I use it to recycle the right hand sides of (<*>)'s in modified contexts
  * A computation would return the set of environment variables read and written

  * Seems to need a deep embedding
  * Is this even relevant with a logict style search

* Can we use propagators to model constraints?
  * Do we replace unification variables with just having join semilattice?
  * Better all-different constraints via the Hall Marriage problem
  * Using discrimination for things like Mehlhorn & Thiel to get more linear
    all-diffable things

* SAT solving
  * Conflict clauses should be able to promoted to be used across worlds
    so long as the latest clause that contributed a unit propagation or
    contradiction is consistent across both worlds.

* Reflection without remorse
  * Can it remove some of the performance difference between triangular
    and idempotent substitutions?
  * Can it fix up some of the hidden costs of LogicT?

* How to nicely use typed environments?
